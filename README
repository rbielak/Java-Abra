INTRODUCTION:

Abra is a light-weight Java persistance layer that allows Java objects
to be stored and retrieved in relational databases. In version 0.1 Oracle
and PostgreSql are supported.

Abra includes tools that generate Java classes that represent the
persistent objects, factory classes to store and retrieve them
and corresponding database schema. The generation is driven by a single
XML configuration file.

OTHER PACKAGES REQUIRED:

To build you need the "ant" tool from Apache:
	http://jakarta.apache.org/ant

To build you need the "regexp" library from Apache:
	http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp

To run you will need an JAX/SAX XML parser. For example:
	http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/index.html

You will also need either Oracle or PostgreSql JDBC libraries.
