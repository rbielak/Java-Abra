    <h1>Optional add-ons to Abra</h1>
<p>Abra allows plugins to operate on JClass/JField structures to generate whatever you want
regarding the data-model.  
<p>To allow for that there are two options to implement
<ul>
<li>Generator
<li>GeneratorPlugin
</ul>
<p>Generator will generate on the existing model with no new data involved the ClassGenerator is 
a 'Generator' as well as the 'EiffelGenerator' in the optional package.
<p>GeneratorPlugin allows new data-tags to be registered and the data saved.  That data
then becomes available during generation 'ValidatorGenerator' is the only current example.

<p>
In either case to add a generator the 'generator' tag must be added to the map-file at the same level as the property/class nodes. 
example
<pre>
&lt;generator name="org.ephman.abra.tools.generators.ValidatorGenerator"/&gt;
</pre>
or to add a generator to override the class generator (ie Eiffel instead of Java)
use a single 'class-generator' tag.

<h2>To Obtain</h2>
Currently only the ValidatorGenerator is included as part of the regular abra distribution.
there is a separate CVS module 'abra-optional' which contains generators and examples/tests of those 
generators.
