2005-Jun-30 rbielak@acm.org
	* Fixed Sybase schema generator. Index definitions and constrains were not generated.

2005-Mar-21 rbielak@acm.org
	* First cut of MS SQL Server support. Clobs of any kind not supported for now. Stored procs not supported either.
	All unit tests run for SQL Server. Build with "ant sqlserver".

	Note that the connect string needed for SQL Server has to contain the parameter "SelectMethod=Cursor", otherwise
	the code that issues multiple selects in a single transaction will throw nasty exceptions.
	
	
2004-Dec-22 rbielak@acm.org
	* Updated Sybase support for ASE 12.x server. Testing done with ASE 12.0.
	List of changes:
		1. ephman/abra/database/GenericFactoryBase.java
			Fixed a bug with statement being called twice. Sybase threw exception on
			second close
		2.org/ephman/abra/database/sybase/DatabaseConnector.java
			Changed message names to say Sybase, instead of Oracle. Updated the URL creation.
		3. org/ephman/abra/tools/GenericSchemaGenerator.java
			Added new routine "getDbSpecificOptions() to allow Sybase add a "null" qualifier
			on columns that are allowed to be null, but by default cannot be. For example "datetime"
			and "int" types are not allowed to be null
		4. src/org/ephman/abra/tools/mysql/SchemaGenerator.java
			changed how primary column definition is written for dbs with auto-increment columns.
		5.org/ephman/abra/tools/sybase/FactoryGenerator.java
			updated for ASE 12.x
		6. org/ephman/abra/tools/sybase/SchemaGenerator.java
			changed how primary column is written. Syntax changed from old Sybase db. For ASE less
			than 12.5 string of 255 or more are set to "text" type

	There were bunch of tweaks to tests. Found that Sybase JDBC does not convert ints to strings if the comparison
	column is varchar, but an integer is passed in the query. In TestTimings put code to skip stored proc based
	tests - I don't need these for now.
		
	
2004-Nov-29 rbielak@acm.org
	* Added a SortAndLimitCriteris class to allow limits placed on the sizes if query results. The code had to be put into
	a class that extends SortCriteria because SQL syntax for limit queries is different for Oracle, MySql and PostgreSql.
	For Oracle it's just another where clause "where (rownum <= N)" but for MySql and PostgreSql it's a limit statement
	at the end of the query "select ... where ... order by ... limit N". Current code will generate invalid SQL if the 
	SortAndLimitCriteria is used without a filter.

2004-Jun-30 rbielak@acm.org
	* Inserted a patch to Marshaller contributed by Leo Tomilchik, to allow the reflective mashaller
	handle Vectors and ArrayList.:
2004-Apr-21 rbielak@acm.org
	* Added "cancelQuery" to DatabaseSession. This will allow cancellation of a running query. The JDBC 
	driver must support such things
	
2004-Mar-23 rbielak@acm.org
	* Changed the implementation of DatabaseCursor to use an int array to hold internal result. This will save on the
	amount of memory used by cursors. 
	* Added a new unit test TestDBCursors.
	
2003-Dec-6 rbielak@acm.org
	* Fixed a bug in MySql schema generation. Statements to create and drop indexes were not 
	generated for MySql.

2003-Nov-11 rbielak@acm.org
	* Added support for query based factories. These factories allow you to treat a result from
	a query as though is was a table. The most immediate application is to provide Abra
	with access to joins. Take a look in the org.ephman.junit package for an example	
	(TestQueryFactories test) and "test.xml" for XML extensions.


2003-Oct-30 rbielak@acm.org
	* Changed top level build.xml file to delete jar files from lib dir on clean.
	* In GenericFactoryBase added an experimental routine to call stored procs (not
	used anywhere else)
	* In DatabaseConnector for MySql changed to use new driver name. See http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc.html for reference
	* Changes to support MySql better. Several types had to be overriden for schema
	generation:
        	1. If string is more than 255 characters, MySql type will be "text"
	        2. Timestamp fields in MySql are "datetime"
	        3. Numbers are of type "numeric"
	Tested with MySql version 4.x

2003-Sep-10 rbielak@acm.org
	* With Paul fixed a bug in DatabaseCursor which caused exceptions when the last sections of the cursor were retrieved 
	in chunks bigger than 90.
2003-Jun-26 rbielak@acm.org
	* Added a "storedProcCall" routine to GenericFactory base to allow factories implement actions
	via stored procs. Useful when different databases have incompatible syntax for querying.
	"storeProcCall" returns an integer from the proc
2003-Jun-13 rbielak@acm.org
	* Added rawCursorQuery to allow passing of SQL strings to Abra factories.
	* Fixed a small bug in GenericFactoryBase. A getAll query would get a null 
	exception, as there was no filter
2003-Jun-11 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Added LimitQuery and SubSelectFilter 

2003-Jun-06 richieb@netlabs.net
	* Made sortExpressions gettable, so that SortCriterias can be combined
2003-Apr-15 richieb@netlabs.net
	* Added "setVector" back to JField, as DtdConvertor needs it.
	
2003-Apr-14 richieb@netlabs.net
	* Changes to support ArrayList as a collection type. Added code to generator to generate proper
	code when collection is set to ArrayList. JUnit test ran, but there is no specific test
	for ArrayList yet. Not sure what to do about Array, as the array code was broken
	to begin with.
2003-Mar-9 richieb@netlabs.net
	* Changed cleanup.sql file generation for Postgres to add "cascade" to drop table.
2003-Feb-5  pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* many changes -- of note support for PSQL 7.3.1 (they renamed Connection)

2002-Sept-12 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Added plugin-generator support documentation to follow
	* Use the Validator generator as a pattern 

2002-Sept-10 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Added support for native Classes (Integer, Character, Long, Double) 
	* as Map-file types so that the idea of being 'un-set' or null
		is propagated to and from the database

2002-Sept-06 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Added Sybase support (connector, FactoryBase, and generators)
	* Sybase junit tests work except Clob, and procs (to be implemented)
2002-Jul-10 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Cleaned up ViewLookup creation procedure to do reflection in its constructor and throw a runtimeException if a problem so that Factories do not need to throw exception any more..
	* Added AbraRuntimeException
	* Fixed intializeFromView method to default to "deep" overlay
	* Added TestAbraViews to verify above fix

2002-Jun-27 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Stream lined build process not rely on CLASSPATH or scripts
	but instead for ant to complain if any of ABRA_HOME,REGEXP_JAR,JDBC_JAR,XML_JAR
	are not set.

2002-Jun-13 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Marshaller - fixed bug where 'Versioned' objects where not getting version_number field into/from XML.  Added option to use Abra XML Parser instead of Xerces
	* Fixed - xml parser to properly handle multi-line text elements..
	* Updated SQL package (still working on diff-schema)
	* Postgres support for CLOBs added (using LargeObject)
	
	
2002-Mar-30 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Fixed bug in order that field are build in 'AllFields' vector.
2002-Feb-22 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Added MySql support for Abra 'mysql' target using
	mmmysql-jdbc driver..

2002-Feb-21 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Required="true" added to the <validate ../> node so 
	that if a required field is missing the object can still be stored
	(NOT NULL constraint)

2002-Feb-18 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Postgres support for stored procedures added.
	* ResourceBundle style error messages ripped out into org/ephman/error.properties
	* Junit tests from 0.8 added to 0.9
	* TestTiming added to test insert in stored proc vs Dyn SQL

2002-Feb-15 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Postgres support for foreign keys, and check constraints added.

2002-Feb-14 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Abstracted to db2-UDB the changes I made and added ant target
	* Succesful runs of family example using ant-db2-UDB.jar on PC/Linux 
	UDB Build

2002-Feb-14 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Added some db2 support found out that UDB and DB2/400 are
	different - will abstract to two builds..
	
2002-Feb-8 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Abstracted some of the generator stuff to allow for DB2
	* Created new db2 directory in abra/tools and abra/database and copied basic files
	* Added 'ant' target to build abra-db2.jar
	
2002-Feb-6 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Added StringFieldError class to the validation package allowing reflective changes to fix any 
	validation errors
	* Fixes to minor bugs in some generators.
	
2002-Jan-16 richieb@netlabs.net
	* Starting a new branch Abra-0.9 to experiment with different
	method of representing object references in the database. We need
	to keep type info and relationship between types in the database.

2002-Jan-14 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* added int errorCode to FieldError and ValidationCodes for basic errors

2002-Jan-8 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* added FieldError to validation package so that the field name is preserved
	* added in-line object storage (and doc)

2001-Dec-21 richieb@netlabs.net and pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* Fixed the XmlProcessor class to load Abra parser at runtime. This
	  removes the dependency on Java Cup when running the mapping/code
	  generation tool. By default Xerces parser is used.

2001-Dec-12 pbethe@wso.williams.edu
	* added org.ephman.xml package with Java CUP generated Xml parser
	  allow plug in of this one to MapToJava using '-xp' flag
	* added validator generation '-validation' using required,lengths, 
	  and <validate regex="a*"/> node inside <field>
	* added hand-written descendants 'descendant' attribute in <class> node
	  allows inheritence of generated data classes, lets factories create the
	  right type.
	* added ant-style <property name="foo" value="42"/> nodes with later 
	  replacement ${foo} for 42
	* added stored-procedures using generic JDBC to FactoryBase and generated Factories
	  added to Oracle SchemaGenerator  (not yet part of PSQL)
	* requires jakarta regexp package see BUILD file
	
2001-Oct-05 richieb@netlabs.net
	* build.xml - modified to build the example. Include code generation
	and schema generation steps.
	* MapToJava.java - turned off XML parser validation. Xerces was spitting
	out lots of messages because we don't have a DTD for the map files.
	* TODO - perhaps which database is being used should be determined from
	an environment variable. Otherwise the build scripts have to have 
	database specific thingies (eg. in examples running code generation
	and in setting of classpaths). 
	

2001-Sep-01 richieb@netlabs.net

	* Added family example in the org.examples package.
	* Changed to use Postgres 7.1. Previous JDBC drivers
	  had bugs with Timestamps and Dates. 7.1 works fine.
	  Note that Postgres 7.1 driver requires Java 1.3.
	
2001-Aug-27 richieb@netlabs.net

	* Revamped build files a little so that externaly defined environment
	variables are used. Changed things so that XML parser and Ant jar files
	need not be included in the distribution.

2001-Aug-25 richieb@netlabs.net
	
	* Example does not work with PostgreSql. THere is a problem with
	retrieving Dates and Timestamps in 6.5 JDBC driver.
	* TODO: Examples should be moved under the single "src" directory
	rather than being in a separate structure. So we'll have a package
	org.ephman.examples
	* We should switch to the Xerces XML parser to make sure we can distribute
	it with the code
	

2001-Aug-22 
	* Initial load of version 0.8
